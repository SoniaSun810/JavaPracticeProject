1. Pipeline Architecture to processing data stream
The Pipeline Architecture is a powerful approach for processing large amounts of data in real-time. It involves breaking down the processing of data into a series of smaller, more manageable steps, which can be executed in parallel. By doing so, it enables faster and more efficient data processing.

2. Subscriber Architecture to handle event
The Subscriber Architecture is a pattern for handling event-driven systems. It involves creating a central event dispatcher that manages the flow of events to subscribers. This approach provides a flexible way to handle events and enables the development of reactive systems.

3. Android Client Java, call Restful API
Develop an Android client in Java and make calls to a RESTful API. We explore the best practices for consuming RESTful APIs on Android and demonstrate how to use the Retrofit library to handle network requests.
